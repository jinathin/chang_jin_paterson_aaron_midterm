Aaron - Debugg the mainNav



Still trying to sort out the navigation alignment and hover feature. Not happy... 

 /* normal black text */
/*#mainNav ul li a
{
	font-size: 16px;
	display: block;
	width: 100px;
	text-align: center;
	color: #000;
	padding: 10px;
}*/

/* hover */
/*#mainNav ul li a:hover
{
	font-size: 16px;
	display: block;
	width: 100px;
	text-align: center;
	color: #fff;
	background-color: #5d7132;
	padding: 10px;

}
*/
/*#mainNav #selected
{
	width: 100px;
	border-radius: 50px;
	padding: 10px;
	background-color: #5d7132;
}*/

# Midterm project from Jin && Aaron

Jin's readme checkpoints 

created master branch and dev branch and started working on contact page 

added images, etc, created contact section of it 

added google map info (also added grid map and commeted it out just in case)

fixed some issues regarding to css mainly 

updated to the github branch

added about page 

added css and html for about page 

had to sort out and clean up css 

and fix the overall issues 

//
git pulled the master branch try to marge my branch to the master as final result

changed quite a bit of css to solve the conflicts

then went ahead in html to make the menus link to each others (such as drop down menu to link to the section of the page)

overall finally pushed to the master branch and now it works as intended
